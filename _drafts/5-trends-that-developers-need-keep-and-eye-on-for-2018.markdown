As we get closer to the New Year, is time to reflect and plan for what 2018 might bring. 

Any developer or entreprenuer worth its salt knows that it's important to stay on top of the latest technologies trends so we can anticipate market and customer demands and meet them where they are at.


## Blockchain

While we should be extremely careful with the recent craze surrounding bitcoin and other sister crypto currencies; we can certainly give credit to bitcoin for bringing a lot of attention to the blockchain technology.

In 2017 we saw many of the Silicon Valley giants experiment or even introducing their own blockchain implementations, IBM been the most significant one by collaborating with food distributors, government regulation agencies and banks for leveraging blockchain.

With applications ranging from cryptocurrency, to smart property, to identity like passports; we have only started scratching the surface of what Blockchain technology can offer and in 2018 it won't be a surprise if we see a rise in the creation and adoption of blockchain based application.


## Conversational Interfaces

From chatbots to voice recognition platforms like Siri and Alexa, conversational interfaces will take a stronger market hold in 2018.

Conversational interfaces are nothing new, and while 2017 saw the birth of counteless chatbots in all number of platforms, 2018 will be the year were conversational interfaces will continue growing and gain significant maturity.

In addition to the raise of chatbots, voice controlled interfaces like Alex, Siri and Google Home are becoming more accessible and common place. Alexa for example just became available in Canada, and as 2018 progresses we will likely see a wider adoption and expansion of each one of this platforms.


## AI will take over ...

AI will take over ... but not in the way you think. In 2018 we will see a raise in solutions and applications augmented by the use Machine Learning/AI.

For many AI seems to be an all or nothing proposition, the reality is that AI is already here and contributing in unexpected ways. In 2018 we will see the transition from AI being somewhat of a buzzword and a nice to have, to an absolute necessity for startups and businesess.

In 2017, there was a significant number of businesses using AI to drive finacial and operation decisions, not only this trend will continue gaining steam but we will also see AI application in less obvious fields.


## The Rise of Backends As A Service (BaaS)

Backend as a service, while typically is not reference by that name is a trend that has been on the rise in 2017 and will continue gaining steam during 2018. 

BaaS turns traditional parts of the backend into a third party service that is consumed by other applications, some good examples of BaaS are push notifications, file storage and sharing, integration with social networks and messaging and chat, just to mention a few.

One trend that I'm expecting to see more of in 2018 is what Shopify is doing with its Storefront API, in which Shopify essentially becomes a headless backend for a fully customizable shopping experience.


## Augmented Reality

While there has been a lot of hype surrounding Virtual Reality in the past couple years, there is still ways to go before it becomes commonplace and widely adopted. On the other hand Augmented Reality, might become mainstream in 2018.

AR and mobile seem to be the perfect marriage and with the release of ARKit by Apple and ARCore by Google, 2018 is poised to be the year where we will see maintstream adoption of AR.
